# Tech Holding - Vue Test
I created this project to share with the Tech Holding team my knowledge using the Vue.js framework. 

I created this project using the `npm init vue@latest` command, which is the recommended way to start a project from scratch. 

Before we start with the project setup please verify that you have:

- node 19.7.0
- npm 9.5.0

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
